        The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (NAVIC) is a
        seven-satellite constellation developed by Indian Space Research
        Organization (ISRO), India. NAVIC provides two services, with the standard
        positioning service open for civilian use, and for authorized users
        (including the military) with an assured absolute positional accuracy.
        NAVIC is designed to cover all the parts of India and also extending
        beyond the Indian borders. The coverage area of NAVIC with routes of
        satellites means and includes area covering entire Pakistan, Afghanistan,
        most of China and Middle East along with Indian Ocean. NAVIC downlink
        signals have two bands: S1 band and L5 Band. Presently Indian users are
        dependent on the civil GPS signals with a positional accuracy of 5 m.
        NAVIC system is intended to provide an absolute position accuracy of (i)
        better than 10 m throughout Indian landmass (ii) better than 20 m over the
        Indian Ocean and (iii) approximately in a region of 1500 km around India.
        There are 15 ground stations across the country responsible for operating
        and/or monitoring the NAVIC seven satellite constellation. A comparative
        analysis of NAVIC and GPS navigational satellites shows that the NAVIC
        consists of sufficient number of satellites for regional navigation system
        and it can also exhibit better performance. The main parameters selected
        for our study are orbital characteristics, position accuracy and
        positional error including Circular Error Probable (CEP), Altitude
        variation, Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) with respect to Number
        of Satellites (NSAT), variations in Carrier to Noise (C/N0) ratio and
        scintillation effect of both GPS and NAVIC satellite systems. Our analysis
        showed that NAVIC systems shall be used as stand-alone systems.

IRNSS has 7 satellites complemented with the appropriate ground
infrastructure as a minimum. As it is traditional in GNSS systems, the
architecture is described next in three different segments: the space
segment, the ground segment and the user segment. The IRNSS Space Segment:
3 of the 7 satellites are geostationary orbit (GEOs) and they are located
at 32.5º East, 83º East and 131.5º East longitude. There are 4
geostationary satellites (GSO) in orbits of 24,000 km apogee and 250 km
perigee inclined at 29 degrees. Two of the GSOs cross the equator at 55º
East and the other two at 111.75º East (two satellites in each plane). The
life span of the GEOs is 9.5 years and 11 years in the case of the GSOs.
The Constellation Design Considerations have been mainly: Minimizing the
Maximum DOP Minimum number of satellites Orbital slots for India for a
continuous visibility with the control stations IRNSS Architecture The
IRNSS Ground Segment consists of: ISRO Navigation Centre IRNSS Spacecraft
Control Facility IRNSS Range and Integrity Monitoring Stations IRNSS
Network Timing Centre IRNSS CDMA Ranging Stations Laser Ranging Stations
Data Communication Network The ground segment is in charge of estimating
and predicting IRNSS satellites position, calculation of integrity,
<!-- ionospheric and clock corrections and running the navigation software.<br></br>

      The Space Unit consists of 24 active satellites which are assembled with
      huge solar panels with rechargeable batteries that act as a power source.
      The function of the satellites in space is to route or navigate the radio
      signals received from the control unit to store and re-transmit the
      message to the respective Receiver Unit.<br></br>

      The Control Unit consists of several monitoring and control stations. The
      monitor stations monitor the GPS satellite signals. These signals are then
      sent to the master control station where operational specifications are
      checked and revised before transmitting the control signals back to the
      GPS satellites. They are sent back through ground antennas.<br></br>

    The User Unit is the term given to all GPS receivers like mobile phones,
    laptops, PC or any other device. The devices receives the signals from the
    GPS satellites and determines how far away it is from each satellite.

The IRNSS User segment: the IRNSS user segment is made of the IRNSS
receivers. They will be dual-frequency receivers (L5 and S band
frequencies) or single frequency (L5 or S band frequency) with capability
to receive ionospheric correction. They will be able to receive and
process navigation data from other GNSS constellations and the seven IRNSS
satellites will be continuously tracked by the user receiver. The user
receiver will have a minimum gain G/T of -27 dB/K.

The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), with an operational name of NavIC (acronym for NAVigation with Indian Constellation; also, nāvik 'sailor' or 'navigator' in Indian languages), is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system that provides accurate real-time positioning and timing services. It covers India and a region extending 1,500 km (930 mi) around it, with plans for further extension. An extended service area lies between the primary service area and a rectangle area enclosed by the 30th parallel south to the 50th parallel north and the 30th meridian east to the 130th meridian east, 1,500–6,000 km (930–3,730 mi) beyond borders.The system currently consists of a constellation of seven satellites, with two additional satellites on ground as stand-by.

The constellation is in orbit as of 2018, and the system was expected to be operational from early 2018 after a system check. NavIC will provide two levels of service, the "standard positioning service", which will be open for civilian use, and a "restricted service" (an encrypted one) for authorised users (including the military).

NavIC based trackers are compulsory on commercial vehicles in Indiaand it is planned to become available in consumer mobile phones in the first half of 2020.

There are plans to expand the NavIC system by increasing its constellation size from 7 to 11.
